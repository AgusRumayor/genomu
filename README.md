Genomu
======

A concurrency-oriented K/V database

Installation
============

In order to build and fire up Genomu, you'll need a couple of things:

* Erlang R16B: http://erlang.org/
* Elixir (latest master branch): https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir
* avahi daemon (only if you're on Linux, don't worry about it on OS X)

To build, simply run `make`. Hopefully, this will end successfully and you
can fire up a test cluster using `make start`. That will start three
nodes (their configs can be found in the ./test directory). Make sure to
check out its web console at http://localhost:9119
